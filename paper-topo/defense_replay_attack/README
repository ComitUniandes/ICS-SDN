The duration of these attacks was handled by:
			if (count >= attack_upper_window):
				attack_lower_limit = attack_upper_window
				random_duration = random.randint(50,200)
		                attack_upper_limit = attack_lower_limit + random_duration
        		        attack_upper_window = attack_lower_limit + 1000
