This data was generated runing the experiment with  a replay attack and a gaussian noise of 0.03, each .log represents the sensor/actuator values at each sample period.
This information was sent in the network between the sensors/actuators and the PLCs. The network information is stored in the pcap files.
s1-eth1: Connects the PLC101 with the switch1 and since all information in the first control loop is either sent by or sent to PLC101, represents all data traffic on loop 1
s3-eth1: Connects the PLC301 with the switch3 and in the same sense as s1-eth1, represents all data traffic on loop 3
